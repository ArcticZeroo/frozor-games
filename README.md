# frozor-games

The end goal is to have some kind of a working Game Engine.

Working:
- Kit management (Selection/Commands/Assignment)
- Waiting Lobby (Scoreboard is currently broken though)
- NotificationManager

Not Working:
- Scoreboards (FrozorScoreboard)
- TeamManager

TODO:
- Actual game
- GameManager

NotificationManager defaults to make stuff look similar to Mineplex's chat.
