# frozor-games

The end goal is to have some kind of a working Game Engine.

Working:
- Kit management (Selection/Commands/Assignment)
- Waiting Lobby (Scoreboard is currently broken though)
- NotificationManager
- Actual Game
- Scoreboard
- Teams
- Kit Perks
- Game Ending/Events/Etc

Not Working:
- Map Loading

NotificationManager defaults to make stuff look similar to Mineplex's chat.
